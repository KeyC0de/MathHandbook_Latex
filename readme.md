# Description 

A handbook for logic, set theory, algebra, geometry, video game math concepts, graph theory, Calculus, discrete math, probability, statistics, number theory, numerical analysis, vector algebra, physics, chemistry and more goodies I've worked on and off throughout the years.

I compiled this several years ago and it's been left dormant among the circuits of my computer..

<<<<<<< HEAD
I used Windows 8.1 x86_64, LATEX and TexMaker.

I provide the source files, which you can open yourself with your own copy of TexMaker.</br>
The built pdf file is called "Math Handbook.pdf".
